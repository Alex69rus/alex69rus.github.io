# 👋 Hi, I'm **Aleksei Kukharev**

### **Tech Lead • Senior Software Engineer • AI Engineer**

I build intelligent, scalable, cloud-native platforms.
With **8+ years** of experience in .NET, Python, distributed systems, and AI engineering, I combine strong architecture skills with hands-on delivery, technical leadership, and a deep focus on reliability, performance, and simplicity.

## 🚀 **About Me**

I specialize in designing and delivering **high-performance microservices**, **AI-powered systems**, and **cloud-native architectures** using:

* **C#/.NET**, Python
* **Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, SQL, NoSQL**
* **Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Observability**
* **RAG/CAG pipelines, vector DBs, AI agents (text + voice)**

I enjoy transforming complex business requirements into practical, clean, maintainable solutions — and I thrive in roles where I can own architecture, lead teams, and drive the long-term technical direction.
